It is *just* an invoice generator, not\r\nan accounting system, although it could be easily used by one.\r\n\r\nThere are tons of invoice generators out there, but one very similar\r\nonline tool is [Invoice Generator](https://invoice-generator.com/) by\r\nthe company Invoiced. The main technical difference is that\r\n[Invoices.Created.Today](https://invoices.created.today/) operates\r\nserver-side as opposed to client-side, meaning you can log in from any\r\ncomputer and have access to all your invoices.\r\n\r\nWhile [the source\r\ncode](https://github.com/rtts/invoices.created.today) is free as in\r\nbeer and speech, the invoices it produces belong solely to the user\r\nthat generated them, of course.",
