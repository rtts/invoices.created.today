# Beautiful invoices, quickly

**This is the PDF invoice generator used by [Return to the
Source](https://returntothesource.nl/en/), provided here for everyone
to use under the [AGPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html)

[Invoices.created.today](https://invoices.created.today/) is a web
application to create beautiful invoices quickly. It is primarily
useful for independent contractors (freelancers), but it's also suited
for small to medium businesses. It is *just* an invoice generator, not
an accounting system, although it could be easily used by one.

There are tons of invoice generators out there, but one very similar
online tool is [Invoice Generator](https://invoice-generator.com/) by
the company Invoiced. The main technical difference is that
[Invoices.Created.Today](https://invoices.created.today/) operates
server-side as opposed to client-side, meaning you can log in from any
computer and have access to all your invoices.

While [the source
code](https://github.com/rtts/invoices.created.today) is free as in
beer and speech, the invoices it produces belong solely to the user
that generated them, of course.
