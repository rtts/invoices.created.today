[Invoices.created.today](https://invoices.created.today/) is a web
application to create beautiful invoices quickly. It is primarily
useful for independent contractors (freelancers), but it's also suited
for small to medium businesses. It is *just* an invoice generator, not
an accounting system, although it could be easily used by one.

There are tons of invoice generators out there, but one very similar
online tool is [Invoice Generator](https://invoice-generator.com/) by
the company Invoiced. The main technical difference is that
Invoices.Created.Today operates server-side as opposed to client-side,
meaning you can log in from any computer and have access to all your
invoices.

While the source code is free like in beer and speech, the invoices it
produces belong solely to the user that generated them, of course.
